    <p>
      Hey, I&apos;m Nathan. I&apos;m a software engineer based out of Brooklyn, New York,
      by way of California and Arkansas. I&apos;m most interested in futurism, urban planning,
      history, biking, and writing. I also like writing, so I&apos;ll probably throw up some things
      I&apos;ve written before, either about programming or about random stuff I&apos;ve
      burned time learning about.
      <br />
      <br />
      You can find me on&nbsp;
