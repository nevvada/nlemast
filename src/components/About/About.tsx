    <p>
      Hey, I&apos;m Nathan. I&apos;m a software engineer based out of Brooklyn, New York,
      by way of California and Arkansas. I&apos;m most interested in futurism, urban planning,
      history, biking, and writing. I&apos;ll probably throw up some things I&apos;ve written
      about here, some programming-related, others random stuff I&apos;ve burned time researching
      or learning about.
      <br />
      <br />
      You can find me on&nbsp;
