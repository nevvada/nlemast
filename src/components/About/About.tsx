    <p>
      Hey, I'm Nathan. I'm a software engineer based out of Brooklyn, New York, by way of California and Arkansas.
      I'm most interested in futurism, urban planning, history, biking, and writing.
      I'll probably throw up some things I've written about here, some programming-related, others random stuff I've burned time researching or learning about.
      <br />
      <br />
      You can find me on <Anchor href="https://github.com/nlemast">Github</Anchor> or <Anchor href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-le-master/">LinkedIn</Anchor>.
