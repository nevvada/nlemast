    <p>
      Hey, I&apos;m Nevada. I&apos;m a software engineer based out of Seattle, Washington,
      by way of California, Arkansas, and NYC. I&apos;m most interested in futurism, urban planning,
      history, and biking. I also like writing, so I&apos;ll probably throw up some things
      I&apos;ve written before, either about programming or random stuff I&apos;ve
      burned time learning about.
      <br />

      You can find me on&nbsp;
