    <p>
      Hey, I'm Nathan. I'm a software engineer based out of Brooklyn, New York, by way of California and Arkansas.
      I'm most interested in futurism, internet rabbit holes, urban planning, history, and most recently, cycling.
      I wrote a lot of papers in college, so I writing is a bit of a passion of mine. I'll probably throw up some things I've written about here,
      some programming-related, others random stuff I've burned time researching or learning about.
      <br />
      <br />
      You can find me on Github or LinkedIn.
    </p>
