  title: 'Duterte and the Bud Dajo Massacre',
  markdown: `
At the East Asia Summit last Friday, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte took the
opportunity to shock an audience of world leaders with the infamous black and white photograph
of the 1906 Bud Dajo Massacre, depicting American soldiers posing proudly in a volcano crater
littered with hundreds of corpses (you can see the grisly photo [here](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oE1Xe0pOsyE/VqsWjQmFrhI/AAAAAAAAKNs/X7qzrZeq4C4/s1600/US%2Bsoldiers%2Bpose%2Bwith%2Bthe%2Bbodies%2Bof%2BMoro%2Binsurgents%252C%2BPhilippines%252C%2B1906.jpg)).

In the wake of the president’s extrajudicial killings that
has seen the deaths of more than 2,000 drug offenders and pushers, contextualizing the
massacre at Bud Dajo is essential to understanding Duterte’s vitriolic comments about
outsiders criticizing him for violating human rights; Obama being called “the son of a whore,”
and the UN Secretary General San Ki-Moon, a “fool,” being just two examples of his uncouth
rhetoric that surpasses Trump in terms of impropriety.
<br><br>
The Bud Dajo Massacre stands as one of
the bleaker moments in a war that often escapes American consciousness. This is the
Philippine-American War (1899-1902), which began at the tail end of the Spanish-American War
(1898). After Spain was defeated in the Battle of Manila Bay, Spain made her exit from the
Eastern Hemisphere. Filipino nationalists seized this opportunity to declare their country an
independent and sovereign state. However, the United States, eager to secure an economic
foothold in Asia, as well as wet her feet in the colonial game played by all significant
European powers, naturally assumed that the defeat of Spain meant the seamless transfer of
authority into her hands. And so began the Philippine-American War.

This war on the Filipino
archipelago can best be described as a proto-Vietnam. With military superiority, the Americans
were trying to subjugate a hostile country whose geography constantly thwarted an easy
victory. The Filipinos utilized the hot, humid, Southeast Asian jungle to conduct guerrilla
style warfare, miring the Americans into a grueling conflict. Often frustrated by the
effectiveness of their enemies’ strategies, the Americans then began to muddy their reputation
as being morally superior to Europeans in terms of war conduct (see the LIFE magazine cover
above), by employing unethical practices which stirred the ire of Americans at home, including
notables like Mark Twain. For one, the American soldiers used concentration camps,
euphemistically titled “protected zones,” to intern the native peoples, which one commandment
referred to as “suburbs of Hell.” They also adopted a scorched earth policy that called for
the razing of entire villages. Moreover, foreshadowing Guantanamo’s waterboarding, the
Americans utilized the ironically titled “water cure,” a method of interrogation involving the
forced consumption of excessive amounts of water, which was then expelled either naturally
through vomiting, or by force. Using these methods, coupled with modern technology, the
Americans eventually forced the Filipino revolutionaries to surrender. However, while this
officially ended the war and made the Philippines a colony of the United States, fighting
continued to happen, especially in the southern region of the country where Duterte himself is
from, the area of Mindanao.
<br><br>
Mindanao is a unique region of the Philippines. Historically, the
peoples of Mindanao and the southern islands had a vastly differing ethnic, religious, and
linguistic identity from those living on the main island of Luzon. For one, most of these
Filipinos were identified as Moros, Spanish for the word Moors, i.e. the Muslim population of
the Iberian Peninsula expelled in the Spanish Reconquista. While Mindanao was an economically
viable area due to its proximity to important South Pacific trade routes, the Moros were
reputed for lawlessness, piracy, slavery, and tribalism. In addition, they ignored any form of
national law, instead basing their legal system on Islamic sharia. Even the Spanish had failed
to fully pacify Moroland, going so far as to transplant Christianized Filipinos from the north
into the area, a tactic that did nothing more than create further antipathy towards all
outsiders.
<br><br>
The American strategy to handling the Moros involved making an agreement with the
local datus, or chieftains, typically via some form of a bribe. America promised to stay out
of the affairs of the Moros, so long as the Moros paid taxes and maintained stability. But
unbeknown to the Americans, the Moros were never a centralized people. Ratifying a treaty with
one datu, therefore, did not promise that the Moros under the authority of a different datu
would not offer resistance. And so, predictably, some of the Moros began to rebel, seeing the
American imperialist as no different than the Spaniard.
<br><br>
With certain slopes at steep 60 degree
angles, and with an eleven mile circumference, the crater of the extinct Bud Dajo volcano was
the perfect hideout for those recalcitrants that refused to concede to the Americans. It was
self sufficient, containing irrigated water pools and patches along the outer rim to grow
crops. It was also very well defended, with multiple defensive fortifications built along the
crest. Aspiring to a famed military reputation, the local American governor felt compelled to
subjugate this stronghold of criminals and their families. And so, from March 7-9 1906, a
force of 800 Americans launched a difficult uphill struggle against this Moro outpost. The
Moros offered a fierce resistance, but once the Americans were able to get a machine gun
safely situated at the rim of the volcano, 600 men, women, and children were killed en masse,
described by one veteran as, “dominoes falling.” A photographer immortalized their victory
with the same photograph Duterte displayed at the Far East Asia Summit.
<br><br>
In the postcolonial
world that’s haunted with issues of identity (think of the agonizing paradox that historically
colonized people are often forced to articulate their struggle for identity through the
language of their colonizers), formerly colonized countries are weary when others, especially
their former colonizer, try to impose a moral reproach. Hence why Duterte reminds the world of
the war that resulted in the death of more than 200,000 Filipinos, a war which America
has yet to issue a formal apology. Naturally, when Obama denounces his policies, Duterte
revives America’s skeletons-in-her-closet, as a way to kick her off her moral high ground. Be
that as it may, that doesn’t excuse Duterte from criticism by America or the United Nations.
And while I’ll concede ignorance to to the reality of drug trafficking and addiction on
Manila’s streets, I will acknowledge that the proposed quick-fix solution of having 100,000
bodies floating in Manila Bay by the end of Duterte first six months in office won’t end the
problem of drugs, just as building a wall won’t prevent people south of the border from coming
into the United States, or Syrian refugees entering Europe. Instead what Duterte needs to
ask is: what are the motivations that push people into the world of drugs? A sense of feeling
economically disenfranchised? A sense of futility towards fighting an extremely corrupt
government? A lack of general welfare? Or is it something within the culture? These are the
questions that Duterte needs to ask himself and the people of the Philippines. Anything less
would be irresponsible.
