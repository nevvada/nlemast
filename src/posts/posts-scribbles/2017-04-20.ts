Just as it sounds, the word,
“tulpa” is not native to the English language. It originates from a Buddhist practice of
fabricating a spiritual being solely through extreme focus and thought. But with the advent of
the Internet, tulpas became inspired with contemporary meaning, thanks to a very surprising
source, the Brony movement. Fanboys of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic reappropriated the
term tulpa to signify an imaginary companion, also created solely by willpower–albeit in their
context, typically ponies from the TV show. Since the early 2010s, tulpas began to include any
being, in whatever form, from whatever source, created by a “tulpamancer”.
<br><br>
Unsurprisingly, 4chan was one of the first crossroads where tulpamancers could meet
and share their ideas. Some members have since migrated to forums, as well as the subreddit
/r/tulpas, where you’ll discover numerous guides on how to create and nourish your tulpa, as
well as countless Q&As addressing every single angle.
<br><br>
Here’s my quick rundown of tulpas and
tulpamancers:
<br><br>

> Tulpas are created to assist in memory recall, to help get rid of negative
feelings, but most importantly, for companionship. This is purportedly a lifelong commitment,
therefore a high level of maturity is believed to be a requisite (one guide explicitly says do
not create a tulpa if you’re young). The tulpa creation process can potentially take months to
years. To create a tulpa, it helps to first imagine a “wonderland,” or an imaginary
environment for your tulpa to inhabit. Tulpas are brought to life via “forcing,” either
“actively,” through a practice similar to meditation, or “passively,” where you train yourself
to direct all of your daily thoughts to the tulpa. It is unhealthy to assume that your tulpa
will take on the form you originally intend. Tulpas are believed to be organic, individual,
stand-alone entities, therefore some “deviation” is expected, just as you can’t expect your
friends to be develop exactly how you want them to be. You can create multiple tulpas,
although creating more than five is discouraged, just as spreading yourself too thin amongst
too many best friends means you can’t give each one the same concentrated attention.
“Switching” is a much more mature concept where you can literally exchange places with your
tulpas, i.e. inhabit your “wonderland” while your tulpa takes control of your body and speech.
<br><br>
Tulpamancers are an inherently shy group. Anybody who’s been on the receiving end of
harassment as a kid knows the source of this defensiveness. Conditioning teaches you that
opening your mouth leads to ridicule, so thoughts worth having are not thoughts worth sharing.
Therefore, whenever someone–journalist, academic, psychologist, or just simply a naturally
inquisitive person–requests an interview with a tulpamancer, the top comments are always
warnings by the veterans, sometimes outright demanding that no one participate, often citing
the 2014 Vice article which they believe spun the tulpamancer community as a group of
basement-dwelling perverts, clutching their Twilight Sprinkle plushies.
<br><br>
However, as
tulpamancers do strive to gain a greater acceptance–emboldened as they are by online
communities–some have begun to ally themselves with the Hearing Voices Movement, advocacy
groups trying to destigmatize the Western diagnosis of disorders like schizophrenia, arguing
that auditory hallucinations are actually a positive, healthy attribute, as evidenced by it’s
greater appreciation amongst some non-Western, less globally-involved cultures. The obvious
foreseeable danger then becomes a muddied distinction between private hobby and genuine mental
illness, an effect that could prove highly calamitous to some.
<br><br>
But knee-jerk reactions aside,
overall, are tulpas really that outlandish? How different is it than any other belief system
that peoples negative space with all kinds of fantastical creatures, gods and devils, angels
and demons, spirits and ghosts? Don’t these projections all originate from the same place, to
not feel so abysmally lonely? From skimming multiple threads on /r/tulpas, you soon discover
that the question of whether or not tulpas are real is irrelevant, especially to these
tulpamancers. Like any religious or spiritual belief that provides a greater sense of
authentic meaning and purpose: if it helps, it helps.

In the sage words of George Costanza,
it’s not a lie…if you believe it.
